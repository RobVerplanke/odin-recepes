        <br>
        <h2>For the Sheet Pan:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. small gold potatoes, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>olive oil + garlic powder, salt, and pepper</li>
            <li>2–3 cups of broccoli florets (I’m using baby broccoli in the photos)</li>
            <li>1–2 lbs. salmon (cut into 2-4 filets)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Lemon Herb Sauce:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6–8 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1–2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>2–3 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>chopped fresh parsley or basil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Roast the Potatoes: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment.<br>
                Add the potatoes to the pan and toss with a little bit of olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.<br>
                Roast for 25 minutes until lightly browned and delicious.</li>
            <li>Make the Life-Changingly Delicious Sauce: While the potatoes are roasting, make your sauce.<br>
                Melt the butter over medium low heat (I usually start with 6 tablespoons and add the last two if needed once the sauce is cooked).<br>
                Add the garlic, shallot, and thyme sprigs; sauté for 3-5 minutes until soft and fragrant.<br>
                Add broth and cream; bring to a low simmer. Let the sauce hang out over low heat until it starts to thicken enough to coat the back of a spoon.<br>
                Remove the thyme sprigs. Whisk in the lemon juice, stir in the herbs, and season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Bake the Salmon and Broccoli: Add the broccoli and the salmon to the potato pan (keeping the potatoes on there).<br>
                Toss or brush with a little more oil, salt, and pepper. Bake for another 10-15 minutes, until the salmon is fully cooked.<br>
                You’re Done: Serve salmon, potatoes, and broccoli with big spoonfuls of sauce, more herbs, and more lemon wedges. This is living.
